/**
 * {@link Sorter} implementation based on a variant of the quicksort algorithm
 * called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort">introsort</a>: when
 * the recursion level exceeds the log of the length of the array to sort, it
 * falls back to heapsort. This prevents quicksort from running into its
 * worst-case quadratic runtime. Small arrays are sorted with
 * insertion sort.
