/**
 * An analyzer wrapper, that doesn't allow to wrap components or readers.
 * By disallowing it, it means that the thread local resources can be delegated
 * to the delegate analyzer, and not also be allocated on this analyzer.
 * This wrapper class is the base class of all analyzers that just delegate to
 * another analyzer, e.g. per field name.
 * 
 * <p>This solves the problem of per field analyzer wrapper, where it also
 * maintains a thread local per field token stream components, while it can
 * safely delegate those and not also hold these data structures, which can
 * become expensive memory wise.
 * 
 * <p><b>Please note:</b> This analyzer uses a private {@link Analyzer.ReuseStrategy},
 * which is returned by {@link #getReuseStrategy()}. This strategy is used when
 * delegating. If you wrap this analyzer again and reuse this strategy, no
 * delegation is done and the given fallback is used.
