/**
 * <p>Base class for Locking implementation.  {@link Directory} uses
 * instances of this class to implement locking.</p>
 *
 * <p>Lucene uses {@link NativeFSLockFactory} by default for
 * {@link FSDirectory}-based index directories.</p>
 *
 * <p>Special care needs to be taken if you change the locking
 * implementation: First be certain that no writer is in fact
 * writing to the index otherwise you can easily corrupt
 * your index. Be sure to do the LockFactory change on all Lucene
 * instances and clean up all leftover lock files before starting
 * the new configuration for the first time. Different implementations
 * can not work together!</p>
 *
 * <p>If you suspect that some LockFactory implementation is
 * not working properly in your environment, you can easily
 * test it by using {@link VerifyingLockFactory}, {@link
 * LockVerifyServer} and {@link LockStressTest}.</p>
