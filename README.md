##Knowledge Sharing Platform

The Knowledge Sharing Platform, called K#, aims to develop a sophisticated enterprise knowledge graph with a set of components such as Knowledge Extraction, Knowledge Transformation, Knowledge Consolidation, Knowledge Update framework. We have constructed the base knowledge by integrating several linked open data sources such as Freebase, Wikidata, GeoNames, etc., and then have extended this knowledge by interlinking a set of enterprise knowledge. 

Currently, the base knowledge has approximately 4.5 billion entities and 20 billion facts for general-purpose and domain-specific knowledge. Some domain knowledge are already interlinked into the base knowledge, including 1.2 million entities for products and specifications, 24 million entities for entertainment contents, 5 million entities for restaurants and dining, 46 million entities for multimedia contents, and 24 million geo-spatial entities.   

1) Extensible Knowledge Graph: K# Knowledge Graph is a knowledge base to enhance intelligent services with semantic information gathered from a wide variety of sources. It starts to provide various facts across heterogeneous subjects, and more domain-specific and commonsense knowledge will be covered in near future.

2) Semantic Search and Reasoning: K# is to realise more of a knowledge engine rather than a traditional information engine model. K# is able to understand the meaning of a given word and how it relates to other objects using semantic knowledge model and reasoning capabilities. See semantic summarisation based on semantic properties for details.

3) Contextual Service Delivery: K# is able to deliver differentiated information via meshing real-time service data with Knowledge Graph based on understanding context. See this example for details.
