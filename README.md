K# stands for Knowledge Sharing Platform, which aims to develop enterprise knowledge graph and ecosystem to provide enhanced knowledge services. Currently, K# consists of 48 million entities, 1.9 billion facts and their semantic relations, which cover a broad range of information.

Extensible Knowledge Graph

K# Knowledge Graph is a knowledge base to enhance intelligent services with semantic information gathered from a wide variety of sources. It starts to provide various facts across heterogeneous subjects, and more domain-specific and commonsense knowledge will be covered in near future. See an example (Cambridge as a location) for details.

Semantic Search and Reasoning

K# is to realise more of a knowledge engine rather than a traditional information engine model. K# is able to understand the meaning of a given word and how it relates to other objects using semantic knowledge model and reasoning capabilities. See semantic summarisation based on semantic properties for details.

Contextual Service Delivery

K# is able to deliver differentiated information via meshing real-time service data with Knowledge Graph based on understanding context. See this example for details.
